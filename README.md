<!-- # Notes
#### Genre: Adventure, Escape, Dungeon

Game Class:
Constructor: name, difficulty, items

Goal: To escape by figuring out word puzzles

Remaining Room Notes:
- Room 5 = in tower, need to find statue and answer riddle to receive rope ladder and tie to beam near balcony to climb down to ledge
- Room 6 = on ledge, look at trapdoor, look up and see something below balcony that couldn't see from in room 5, use something to get it to fall onto trapdoor to break it open (use stick to prod object to fall?)
- Room 7A = damp cave, connected to room 7B by narrow stairs, searching here gives clue that need to find password among other items hidden in previous rooms
- Room 7B = cavern connected to the ocean with a locked boat, need password to unlock and escape
